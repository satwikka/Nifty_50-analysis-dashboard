🚀 Nifty 50 Stock Performance & Insights with SQL + Excel 📊

I recently worked on a comprehensive SQL project analyzing the Nifty 50 stocks. The goal was to extract meaningful insights on performance, liquidity, volatility, and ranking over time.

What I did:

Identified best and worst performing stocks overall.

2️⃣ Volume & Liquidity Insights

Found which stocks trade the highest volumes monthly.

Measured money flow (turnover) to see which stocks attract the most investment.

Calculated daily and monthly average traded volumes.

3️⃣ Volatility Analysis

Used daily high-low spread as a volatility metric.

Compared volatility of top 5 stocks to identify risk patterns.

4️⃣ Stock Ranking & Comparison

Ranked top 5 gainers and losers each month.

Found best and worst performing stocks of the year.

5️⃣ Time-Based Insights

Identified best performing month/year for each stock.

Revealed seasonal trends, i.e., months with higher average returns.

6️⃣ Combined Monthly Insights

Aggregated returns, volume, turnover, and volatility for each stock per month.

Filtered for stocks with positive returns, above-average liquidity, high turnover, and lower-than-average risk.

Highlighted top 10 promising stocks based on these criteria.

💻 Workflow:

Performed all calculations using SQL.

Exported the processed data to Excel for analysis.

Created visualizations and dashboards in Excel to highlight trends and insights.

💡 Impact:
This workflow allows investors and analysts to quickly identify strong performers, assess risk, and make data-driven investment decisions.
